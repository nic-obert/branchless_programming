# True Branchless Programming

This repository contains implementations of various programs and algorithms
using a **true branchless approach**.  
The rules are:

- **No if statements** or ternary operators
- **No condition-based loops**, only `while (true)` allowed
- **No conditional jump instructions** allowed in the binary code
